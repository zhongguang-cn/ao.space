AO.space is a solution that focuses on protecting personal data security and privacy. Utilizing end-to-end encryption and device-based authentication, users have complete control over their personal accounts and data. AO.space also employs various technologies, including transparent platform forwarding, peer-to-peer acceleration, and LAN direct connection, to enable fast access to personal data from anywhere at any time. Leveraging Progressive Web App and cloud-native technology, AO.space has developed an integrated application ecosystem that could include both front-end and back-end components.

AO.space is composed of three parts: server-side, client-side, and platform. The server-side and client-side run on personal devices and establish encrypted communication channels with public key authentication. The server-side supports x86_64 and aarch64 architectures and can run on personal servers, computers, or other similar devices. The client-side supports Android, iOS, and web platforms, providing users with the convenience of using AO.space anywhere and anytime.

### Server repository introduction @zhongguang

The server is the main data carrier of AO.space and is also the core of data protection. It consists of the following repositories:
  
- [space-agent](https://github.com/ao-space/space-agent)：It provides services such as device binding, system service module startup bootstrapping, and management.
- [space-aofs](https://github.com/ao-space/space-aofs)：It provides file access services, including interfaces for file querying, chunked uploading, downloading, and more.
- [space-gateway](https://github.com/ao-space/space-gateway)：The end-to-end request security processing module receives requests, decrypts them, and forwards them to the relevant modules. It encrypts the responses and sends them back to the requesting client.
- [space-filepreview](https://github.com/ao-space/space-filepreview)：It supports the generation of thumbnails and preview images for media files. This functionality allows users to generate smaller versions or preview images of their media files, which can be useful for displaying file previews or creating thumbnails for faster loading.
